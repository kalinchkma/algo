## Data Structure Choice:

We chose a doubly linked list to efficiently manage the insertion, deletion, and
traversal of employee data. It allows easy bi-directional traversal, which is
useful for sorting and searching operations.

## Algorithms Used:

- Sorting:

  - Merge Sort: O(n log n)
  - Quick Sort: O(n log n) average, O(n^2) worst case

- Searching:

  - Linear Search: O(n)
  - Binary Search: O(log n)

- Statistical Calculations:

  - Median, Mode, Consistency Score: O(n) using NumPy

- Performance Trend Analysis:
  - O(1) for each employee
